```
My dearest Astrid,

Here's a little present for you.
Thanks for rocking!

Yours,
Nikolai

"Calendar View for Astrid" is a simple add-on to the Astrid.com interface that overlays your tasks in a calendar. You'll be able to quickly and easily reschedule tasks and see how balanced your task load is over time.

Also: "Calendar View for Astrid" will need you to authenticate with your Astrid username and password. However, for your safety, this extension does not store any authentication or personal info.

Tip: You may need to disable Astrid's Hotkeys temporarily while entering your log in info since you may accidentally trigger hotkeys while typing your username and password. You will most likely only need to log in once ever really.
